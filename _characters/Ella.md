<h3 class="{{page.name}}-font">My name is Ella Oakden.</h3>

I was born Princess Elovera Goldthorne to Duke Zevren Goldthorne and Duchess Valora Goldthorne of Silverley City. Silverley is governed by my family and has been for generations.

My family's history is one of treachery and deceit, one that I am not proud of. To put it briefly, my family will lie, cheat, bribe, and steal if necessary to put themselves closer to the throne. They force an unfairly high tax on the people and continually send more men off to war with no warning. They see those they govern as lesser - lower-ranking elves, then half-elves beneath those, and humans least of all. As a result of their prejudice, I was only allowed to be friends with other high-ranking noble children.
I was seldom allowed to leave home, and anything we needed was brought to us. A slew of private tutors were hired to educate me on a wide range of subjects. Since my parents were usually attending to political or, more often, personal business, they hired a nanny to take care of me. She was a half-elf named Devinni. I called her Nanny Vin. I don't actually know much about her, except that I was told she's a family friend. She's nothing like my family though; she's always been kind, humble, and honest. She practically raised me and has been like a mother and best friend to me.

I grew sick of being stuck in the castle, and eventually I was bold and curious enough to sneak off the grounds entirely and into the city.
The influx of sights, smells, and sounds was overwhelming. I came across a street magician and was captivated. While standing in the small crowd, I met an elven boy my age named Salvaros. Although I was a bit awkward, he was very friendly and we hit it off. I was very recognizable by my long hair as the Duke’s daughter, and everyone was respectful but distant towards me. Sal was different. He treated me like I was just another kid and made me forget my status. He had to finish running errands, and I knew I should return home before my parents noticed. We said goodbye and parted ways.

Over the next two years I snuck out whenever I could. I would meet Sal on the corner the street magician was usually at. We were both enamored with the man's sleight of hand, and watched and practiced his tricks together. Sal also showed me around the city; we visited shops, eateries, and farms on the outskirts of town. I found out Sal’s father had been sent to the war by my parents, and he had to work to help support their family. I felt terrible, but he didn’t blame me.

It was during this time I realized how different my life was from others, and how my parents’ rule affected the citizens of Silverley. People lived in tiny rooms above shops, or in small farmhouses. They wore plain clothing, and ate simple meals of bread, cheese, and sometimes meat. Others had nowhere to live, no food to eat, and only rags for clothing. With many men sent to aid the King’s army, there were many mothers left to raise and support a family alone. And with such high taxes, even families with both parents struggled to make a living. This astounded me. It didn't seem fair to me that we had so much, while these people had so little.

I returned with a burning desire to set things right in any way I could. I began finding ways to take "lost" belongings from our house and sell them for money to give to the poor. Sometimes visiting dukes and duchesses would “lose” things as well. A spoiled noble girl my age once called Nanny Vin a "filthy half-breed", and her favorite earrings mysteriously vanished soon after.

One afternoon when I arrived back home, I found my parents waiting for me. That spoiled noble girl was visiting with her parents and saw me leaving, so she followed me. She found out who I was seeing and what I was doing, and ratted me out to my parents. They reprimanded me and restricted me to the house, assigning a couple of guards to monitor my whereabouts at all times.

For almost two years I resigned to my captivity. I hated it, but I was watched closely and could never find an opportunity to escape. My parents became more occupied with politics, and the guards eventually grew more lax until one day I saw an opening and slipped out of the castle.

The city was even worse than when I’d last visited. I couldn’t find Sal on the streets or in the shops, so I showed up at his house. Only his mother was there. When she saw me she was furious, and broke down sobbing. She told me that two years ago my father had ordered that Sal be sent to war. He was younger than was supposed to be sent, and none of the other boys his age were forced to leave. She blamed me and angrily told me to leave.

I was devastated. I realized this had been my family's plan all along, and that this was the true punishment. Word had spread, and people knew not to associate with the Duke's daughter. My long hair, which was a symbol of status in elven nobility, already stuck out like a sore thumb; now it was like a beacon warding townsfolk away.
I decided then and there that I wanted to run away. I snuck back into the castle long to pack a few supplies and tell Nanny Vin goodbye, and then that night I left the city.

From then on, I told everyone my name was Ella Oakden. I cut my hair short, knowing that being long it was a dead giveaway to my identity. I wanted a fresh start without the weight of my family’s name pulling me down.
I’d heard of the acceptance and generosity of the sun elves, so I decided on a whim that that’s where I would go. I headed south.

### What The Party Knows About Me

My name is Ella Oakden. I'm from Silverley, a sizable Moon Elf city in the north. I had a falling-out with my family and fled from home at age 18. They were cruel and greedy people, and made me want to make the world a better place.

I traveled on my own for a few years, earning money by doing magic (slight of hand) tricks in the streets and taking odd jobs where I could. Any money leftover always went to beggars and the most charitable local church. I picked up fighting skills to defend myself in the world.

Eventually I ended up in Clearport, where I met an old friend and the group I'm currently traveling with.

### How I Met The Party

I met a dwarf named Talic soon after I ran away, in a town close to home called Encino. I had just started out on my own and, being used to the cushy life I'd grown up in, I was certainly not ready for the world. One night I was giving money to a local begger in an alleyway, a couple of thugs saw me. As they closed in, a strong-looking dwarf showed up around the corner and threatened to beat them to a pulp if they didn't leave me alone. The thugs decided to find easier prey and left. She introduced herself as Talic. We hit it off, and she taught me some street smarts I desperately needed. I knew how to fence very well, but she helped me apply those skills to actual fights. We became close friends in this time. She is the only person who knows the truth about my family. After a few months in Encino unfortunately I was recognized by a couple of people, and so I had to leave town. It wasn't until a few years later in Clearport when I would run into Talic again.

When I met Talic again in Clearport, she was in the company of two men, one of which was the human Conren. I had seen him frequenting a few taverns and job boards in the small town outside Clearport for bounties. From what I could tell he was relatively new here as well. He's a noble, but not like any I've gotten to know. One night I went to one of the local taverns for a meal, but realized I came up short because I'd given a few extra coins to a begging child. Conren stepped in and covered my meal, then left before I could get his name and thank him.

The other man Talic was with was a halfling named Cael... yfus... Something or other. He had quite the name, and I didn't catch all of it. For such a small person he has a lot of attitude. Heck, for a normal person he has a lot of attitude. He thinks he's the best thing since the bag of holding.
