<h3 class="{{page.name}}-font">My name is Conrin Barrith.</h3>

I am the sole heir to the Barrith holdings, or what's left of them. My father,
mother, sisters, and brother were killed by a band of vampires led by the devil prince, Azgrath Malanor.
They destroyed everything; my family home, Astervale, was burned to the ground. The townsfolk were left to
fend for themselves; many were slaughtered and others forced to flee into the wildlands. I was out hunting
in the woods to the east and once I returned I saw what remained. Outside the burned and broken castle door,
my mother lay with sword in hand, the dirt around her stained red. I rushed to her side in her dying moments,
and she leaned up to me and told of who had committed such an act. My father was taken that day; my family killed.
I mourned for a day, wandering the streets, helping if I could, but mostly wandering aimlessly through the
charred remnants of where I was raised. Once I regained my senses, a deep, burning hatred rose within in me.
Fueled by the memory of my dead family and missing father, the flames of vengeance ate away at my soul. Only
after I have slain Malanor, recovered my father, and regained my family's pride, can I finally rest.

Until now I've been on the road. Travelling from place to place looking for souls brave enough to help me
in my quest. For now, I've settled on adventuring; earning coin by slaying pests and helping those in
need. However, I can feel the fire still burning inside, and its glow has become stronger as of late; soon,
I shall find the help I desire. Soon, I shall take the fight to my enemy. Soon.
