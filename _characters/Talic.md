<h3 class="{{page.name}}-font">My name is Talic.</h3>

I was born in Brujj, a modest dwarven city on the edge of the Gedron mountain range. I come from a family of armorers, and I have 7 siblings, 4 older and 3 younger. I learned the family trade, but knew I always wanted to see the world and do bigger and more exciting things than build armor underground, so I left home at 27, and spent the next decade or so traveling around, doing odd jobs, and losing all of my money on dice games. The closest I came to settling down was in Encino, a town just south of (whatever city Tanya’s character, Ella, is from). I had a job working with the local smith, and while I never crafted anything fancier than farm equipment, it was honest work, and I was able to rent a room to live in, albeit in the more run-down part of town. I made some friends in the neighborhood, and I joined some friendly dice games in the taverns, working my way into higher stakes games with increasingly disreputable people.

One day, after a particularly long streak of bad luck, I had doubled down on the last of my money, wagering against Arkan, a particularly nasty crime boss, and on the last roll, there was a flash of golden light and I had won. I jumped up, and ran directly into my goddess, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She introduced Herself as The Golden Lady, and told me that She was gifting me with Her favor, and that, should I choose to follow Her path, I would be blessed in everything I set out to do. I, of course, agreed, stuffing my pockets full of winnings and She said She would find me again soon. After She left, Arkan demanded a rematch, free from divine interference. I refused, insisting that he was just being a sore loser, and he and his companions drew their weapons. I ran, but knew they would catch up eventually, so I headed for a nearby open market, and loudly proclaimed that a goddess had chosen me to bring good fortune to all, and threw nearly all of the money into the air. Cheers went through the crowd, and people scrambled to collect whatever they could, allowing me to escape in the chaos.

I was on the run for several days before She appeared again, this time with directions to Her temple, in the moderately sized city of (whatever city we’re starting in). I arrived absolutely destitute, having spent what money I hadn’t thrown away in Encino on my travel expenses. The gatekeeper demanded my last coin for entry, and when I reached into my pockets to show him that I had nothing left, I found Her token, a shining gold coin with Her image stamped on it, and was admitted to the temple. There I was taught financial management, how to run a business, and was assigned medicine as a technical field to master. I spent 5 years at Her temple to hone my skills. I was given a strict set of rules to live by, that included abstaining from all forms of gambling and honoring the pure and lawful name of our Goddess, Waukeen. I currently live just outside the temple, and I practice medicine out of the temple and frequently travel around to learn more from other practitioners and periodically visit other smaller towns and villages in the area, earning money for my Goddess and Her temple.

### What The Party Knows About Me

### How I Met the Party

I met Ella in Encino, and we were good friends back in my gambling days. I taught her some tricks to fleece the young nobles she was surrounded by, and helped her out of a few scraps with local riff-raff, and she helped me out when I couldn’t pay my rent. She’s the only who knows that I’m female, despite my beard, and we are comfortable being in close proximity with each other. I know her backstory, and she knows mine, and I absolutely trust her and her intentions. She is the only one who knows I had a gambling problem, and that I still struggle with that. She casually calls me Tali, but I won’t respond if other people use that nickname.

I have heard local gossip about Conrin, and respect him for his enterprising nature as well as his skills in the field. I do not know him very well, but I do not distrust him, though we haven’t bonded enough for me to comfortable around him yet.

I’ve also heard local gossip about Caetheus, none of it good, but I respect that he’s searching for bigger and better things. I see him more as a tool or resource to be leveraged for financial gain rather than have an emotional attachment to him, although I have patched him up several times, and feel an almost nostalgic need to keep him alive. I am good at talking to him and talking him into agreeing with me without him realizing it, and I feel comfortable that he sees me as an ally and an asset to his cause.
